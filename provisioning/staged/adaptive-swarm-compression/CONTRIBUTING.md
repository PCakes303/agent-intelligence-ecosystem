# Contributing

## Current stage

The project is experimental. No open-source license has been selected yet, so external contributions and redistribution are not currently invited. Contributions should favor small, testable changes and reproducible evidence over speculative claims once the licensing terms are established.

## Before proposing a change

- Read README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and SECURITY.md.
- Identify whether the change is lossless, bounded-loss, approximate, or semantic.
- State codec and dependency versions.
- Include a baseline and measurable hypothesis for performance changes.
- Preserve exact source evidence where required.

## Code expectations

- Type hints for public Python interfaces.
- Deterministic tests where possible.
- Byte-for-byte round-trip tests for lossless transformations.
- Explicit error handling for malformed data and unsupported versions.
- No hidden network access or arbitrary plugin execution.
- Document resource limits and worst-case behavior.

## Benchmark expectations

Report full accounting boundaries, including metadata and shared dependencies. Include negative results and avoid comparing different input workloads.

## Pull requests

Keep pull requests focused. Explain behavior, compatibility impact, test coverage, security implications, and benchmark evidence. Do not describe planned functionality as implemented.
