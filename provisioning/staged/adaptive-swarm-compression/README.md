# Adaptive Swarm Compression

**Status:** Experimental · Early architecture and implementation scaffold

A public experimental research implementation exploring adaptive, collective compression and intelligent information representation across distributed agents and swarms.

The project investigates a broader objective than minimizing bytes in an isolated file:

> Minimize the total cost of making information useful across storage, communication, computation, retrieval, reconstruction, coordination, and verification.

## Why this project exists

Conventional compression is essential, but distributed intelligent systems create additional opportunities and costs:

- Multiple agents may hold overlapping information.
- Repeated structures and shared context may be represented once and referenced.
- Event histories and changing state may be represented as deltas.
- Graphs and structured records may benefit from relationship-aware encodings.
- A query may need only a projection or a small region of a large dataset.
- Some operations may be performed on encoded structures without full reconstruction.
- The best representation may change as access patterns, network conditions, and swarm topology change.

This project explores these opportunities while retaining conventional codecs as baselines and building blocks.

## Non-negotiable technical boundaries

- **No impossible compression claims:** arbitrary incompressible data cannot be losslessly reduced to an arbitrarily small fixed size.
- **No hidden loss:** lossy, probabilistic, predictive, and semantic representations must be explicitly typed and labeled.
- **Exactness is testable:** lossless pipelines must reconstruct byte-for-byte identical inputs.
- **Count the whole system:** dictionaries, indexes, metadata, model weights, coordination traffic, caches, and recovery data count toward cost.
- **Preserve source authority:** derived representations do not silently replace authoritative evidence.
- **Fail safely:** malformed inputs, resource exhaustion, incompatible versions, and missing dependencies must be handled explicitly.

## Initial architecture

The implementation is intended to grow through small, testable layers:

1. **Workload characterization** — measure size, entropy proxies, repetition, structure, access pattern, and constraints.
2. **Codec and transform registry** — describe available transformations and their guarantees.
3. **Pipeline composer** — assemble compatible transformation sequences under bounded search.
4. **Representation manifest** — record format/version, pipeline, dependencies, integrity, and exactness.
5. **Benchmark harness** — compare baseline and candidate pipelines with full cost accounting.
6. **Swarm coordination adapters** — later experiments for shared dictionaries, references, distributed placement, and recovery.
7. **Selective operations** — later experiments for querying or transforming encoded structures without full reconstruction.

The early implementation will favor transparent interfaces and reproducible baselines over premature distributed complexity.

```

This is the current repository layout. The pipeline currently supports local identity and zlib lossless stages; swarm coordination, adaptive selection, and selective operations remain planned.

## Running the baseline benchmark

Install the development dependencies and run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
python -m benchmarks.run --size 262144 --seed 931
```

The benchmark emits JSON for deterministic repetitive, structured-record, numeric-series, and random-byte workloads. It compares identity and zlib using one local sample per workload. This is a smoke-test baseline, not publishable performance evidence: it excludes serialized capsule metadata, indexes, dictionaries, network transfer, coordination, replication, and recovery. Repeat runs and broaden the accounting boundary before drawing conclusions.

## Machine-readable repository contracts

- [Repository manifest](manifest.json) — identity, version, dependencies, license status, security boundaries, and evidence.
- [Capabilities](capabilities.json) — current scaffolded capabilities, planned work, and explicit non-capabilities.
- [Compatibility](compatibility.json) — declared ecosystem relationships; no cross-repository combination is marked tested.
- [Agent index](llms.txt) and [agent instructions](AGENTS.md) — machine discovery and safe contribution guidance.

## Initial research tracks

- **Codec composition:** combine established lossless algorithms where measurements justify it.
- **Collective redundancy:** evaluate shared dictionaries, deduplication, and cross-agent references.
- **Structured folding:** represent graph fragments, event streams, and state transitions compactly.
- **Representation selection:** choose pipelines based on data properties and workload.
- **Selective reconstruction:** retrieve or reconstruct only the region needed.
- **Compute while encoded:** investigate operations supported directly on selected encoded forms.
- **Swarm economics:** measure whether collective gains exceed coordination and recovery overhead.

## Evaluation model

Every benchmark should report, where applicable:

- Original and encoded bytes
- Metadata, dictionary, index, and model bytes
- Network bytes and number of transfers
- Encode/decode and query CPU time
- Peak memory
- Query latency and throughput
- Reconstruction correctness
- Integrity verification
- Coordination overhead
- Recovery behavior after node loss or network partition

Compression ratio is one metric, not the objective function.

## Relationship to the Agent Intelligence Ecosystem

This project is a focused implementation domain, not a replacement for AIX or the ecosystem's existing repositories.

Potential integration points, subject to interface review:

- `aix-codecs` — codec and encoding interoperability
- `aix-core` — representation negotiation and capability semantics
- `agent-resource-manifest` — resource and representation metadata
- `swarm-state-mesh` — shared state, references, and recovery
- `swarm-runtime` — distributed execution and scheduling
- `intelligence-knowledge-graph` — relationship-aware representations
- `agent-audit-provenance` — transformation history and evidence lineage

Integration should reuse existing contracts where appropriate rather than duplicate them.

## Development status

This repository is at the foundation stage. A research direction or planned interface is not a completed feature. Each capability will be accompanied by implementation, tests, and benchmark evidence before being described as supported.
